# A Cooperative Vehicle Routing Platform for Logistic Management

The platform implements a cooperative routing algorithm for the transport of goods initially presented in [1].
We have also adapted the platform to the healthcare context to allow the cooperation between two independent healthcare organizations (shippers) that manage their own vehicle fleets in a given geographic area in order to obtatin a reduction in distribution logistic costs.
See [2] for more details.
